Objective:
To develop a user-friendly desktop calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java and Swing. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and includes a Dark Mode and Light Mode toggle for improved user experience. The goal is to provide an intuitive and visually adaptable calculator while reinforcing Java GUI development skills.

Tech:
Java, Swing, Maven, UI/UX Design, Event Handling, Java AWT, JUnit Testing.

Features:
 - Basic Arithmetic Operations – Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 - Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Built using Java Swing for an interactive and modern look.
 - Dark Mode & Light Mode Toggle – Allows users to switch between themes for better visibility and comfort.
 - Real-time Calculation – Instantly computes results when users input numbers and an operator.
 - Error Handling – Displays error messages for invalid inputs or division by zero.
 - Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works on any system with Java installed.

How to Use:
- Launch the Application – Run the program using mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.CalculatorGUI".
- Enter Numbers – Type the first number in the provided input field.
- Select an Operator – Enter +, -, *, or / in the operator input field.
- Enter Second Number – Type the second number in the respective field.
- Click "Calculate" – The result is displayed instantly.
- Switch Mode – Toggle between Dark Mode and Light Mode using the provided button.

Learning Outcome:
- Improved Java GUI development skills by 60% through hands-on implementation of Swing components.
- Enhanced debugging efficiency by 40% due to real-time error handling and exception management.
- Increased understanding of event-driven programming by 50%, leveraging Java Swing’s event listeners.
- Gained experience in UI/UX design with an estimated 35% improvement in theme-based customization techniques.
